# OOP-S3-in-R
* Introduce Object Oriented Programming (OOP) in R based on the most commonly used S3 system and explain the relationship between objects and their methods (a.k.a. functions in the context of OOP)  
* Provide examples to show how R classifies and identifies S3 objects 
* A fun example will show how easy it is to create S3 generic function
* Motivation for the purpose of S4 system using SummarizedExperiment Bioconductor object  

Soon, I will come back with a separate lecture on S4 and R6 OOP systems in R.
