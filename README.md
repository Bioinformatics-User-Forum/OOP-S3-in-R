# OOP-in-R
Introduce OOP in R based on the most commonly used S3 system and explain the relationship between objects and their methods (a.k.a. functions in the context of OOP).  Finally using examples show how R classifies and identifies S3 objects. An example will show how easy it is to create S3 generic functions.
